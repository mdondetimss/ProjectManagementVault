Every pitch can make or break a deal.

But not all decks are created equal.

Here are the only 10 slides you need in your pitch:

Canva’s Chief Evangelist Guy Kawasaki distilled the art of the pitch down to a simple, yet effective formula.

Here's how it works:

1. **Title:** Make them remember your name. It’s your first handshake.

2. **Problem:** If they don’t feel the problem, they won’t see the need.

3. **Value Proposition:** Here’s where you shine. Show your product, its benefits, and why it’s a game-changer.

4. **Magic:** What’s your secret sauce? Tech, patents, a killer demo.

5. **Business Model:** How will you make money? Be crystal clear.

6. **Marketing/Sales:** Your strategy to dominate the market.

7. **Competition:** Know your enemies and why you’re better.

8. **Team:** Investors bet on jockeys, not just horses. Show them your A-team.

9. **Financials:** Hit them with numbers that make sense.

10. **Status & Use of Funds:** Where you are, where you’re going, and how their money helps.

There you have it.
